<p> I came across Chester Bennington when I came across his unique singing style in a band called Linking Park back in my 20's. He could sing both like an angel and with rage, which is very hard to do and still have a voice long term. I have loved hearing his songs ever since.
 </p> 
 
 <p> It has been 6 years since the report of his death, and he still being mourned by those who knew him. his fans and family. 
   </p>

   <p>
     He had a rough snildhood and earlt teens that shaped him into the adult we knew. The only thing he every wanted to do was write songs. Alot of his (their) songs invlove feelings and topics that everyone can relate to.
